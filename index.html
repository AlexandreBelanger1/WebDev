I am finished my exams (and hopefully finished university for good now!) so I am turning my focus onto finding a job in my field and improving my skills in software development and electronics with projects. I have made a new Unity game to play in the browser, the automated greenhouse is finished, the garden is growing out of control, and the older Unity game has a big update with new graphics, inventory system and map improvements on the way (screenshots to show but no uploaded demo yet). Lots of new website content being added today :)</td>
