        <h2>Hi, I'm Alex</h2>
        <a>I am a passionate software developer, graduating in Electrical Engineering this year, who enjoys learning through action. At any given moment, there are guaranteed to be a few ongoing projects that I am working on, picking up new skills along the way. </a>
        <a><br>I first found my love for computers at the age of 5, playing point and click adventure games (shoutout to pajama sam and freddy fish)</a>
        <a>and my first attempt at creating software was a choose-your-adventure style powerpoint file that had hundreds of pages with (somewhat) functional minigames although they were manually operated that I made in second grade.</a>
        <a><br>Since then, I have studied at the University Of Calgary where I re-discovered my love for software creation, and will be graduating in April this year.</a>
        <a> Now, when I want to program a game, I use a game engine with C# scripting instead of powerpoint slides. School has taught me a variety of programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Matlab, and VHDL, but I have gone beyond learning from school and now have professional experience with python, SQL, Flux. </a>
        <a>Even now, I am learning new software (and networking) skills as I build this webserver, running a Node.Js server, load distributed using Nginx, hosted on a debian OS on a Rasberry Pi 3, and using a dynamic IP tracker to bypass the need to buy a static one which is how you are able to reach this page now! </a>
